paperwork game prototype
========================

Some ideas and notes for a game where you fill out forms.
Inspirationally downstream of "papers, please", but with the reversal
that the "annoying unfun task" is not checking paperwork, but being
tasked with completing it correctly, in the face of potentially
obscure, concealed, annoying, pedantic requirements.

Maybe you're effectively jailed, and the goal of the game is to obtain
your release.

Possible resources:
```
 Stamps (different types?)
 Paper (different sizes?)
 Carbon paper
 Pencils
 Pens (don't allow backspace?)
 Photographs
 Camera
 Radio
 Lamination
 Passport/other identity cards
 License cards
 Food - maybe you get free nutrient bars for a time
 Soap - keeps up morale, or dirt on forms invalidates them
 Form catalog
 Batteries
 Law books
 Bank account
```

How to make money:
 - market-making in imperfect information
 - exploiting seasonal time difference in prices
 - add value by assembling raw materials
 - buy in bulk, sell individually

Bills:
 - Trash collection
 - Electricity
 - Water

Send forms in order to:
- transfer money
- obtain change from the bank
- receive many photocopies of a form
- requesting what they're willing to buy
- requesting what they're willing to sell
(can receive the same forms if you put out ads)

Can scan the yard for scrap. Might find a bottle or pen or scrap of
paper. Bottles can be put in recycling bin for money.

- Puzzles arising from deducing the full address of destinations.

- Puzzles arising from needing to bribe certain parties to break out
  of dependency loops (e.g. you need to have a class D bank account to
  file the creation of a limited liability corporation, but an llc
  name is required to open a class D bank account)

- Puzzles arising from forms or envelopes only having limited space
  for writing.

- Puzzles arising from being forbidden after a certain point from
  possessing certain objects or resources. E.g., you're not permitted
  cash, so you have to purchase things with bank accounts you've
  already set up.
