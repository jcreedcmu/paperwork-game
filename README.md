paperwork game prototype
========================

Some ideas and notes for a game where you fill out forms.
Inspirationally downstream of "papers, please", but with the reversal
that the "annoying unfun task" is not checking paperwork, but being
tasked with completing it correctly, in the face of potentially
obscure, concealed, annoying, pedantic requirements.

Maybe you're effectively jailed, and the goal of the game is to obtain
your release.

## How to make money

 - market-making in imperfect information
 - exploiting seasonal time difference in prices
 - add value by assembling raw materials
 - perform services (cooking, camera repair, translation)
 - buy in bulk, sell individually

### Bills
 - Trash collection
 - Electricity
 - Water

## Things to do with forms
Send forms in order to:

- transfer money
- obtain change from the bank
- receive many photocopies of a form
- requesting what they're willing to buy
- requesting what they're willing to sell
(can receive the same forms if you put out ads)

## Other Things to Do

Can scan the yard for scrap. Might find a bottle or pen or scrap of
paper. Bottles can be put in recycling bin for money.

- Maybe the yard runs out of bottles (or other resources) after a
  certain amount have been collected.

- Maybe other specific economic opportunities dry up after a time, or
  after they've been exploited a certain amount.

- Puzzles arising from deducing the full address of destinations.

- Puzzles arising from needing to bribe certain parties to break out
  of dependency loops (e.g. you need to have a class D bank account to
  file the creation of a limited liability corporation, but an llc
  name is required to open a class D bank account)

- Perhaps other bribery mechanics

- Dates matter? Postmark dates matter? A puzzle where you are required
  to lie about the current date because by the time the form is
  received, the date you put down is in principle possible to have
  been the one you sent it on, but in practice impossible because of
  transit time?

- Different classes of stamps leading to different transit times?

- Requesting the information of merely what date it is?

- Puzzles arising from forms or envelopes only having limited space
  for writing.

- Puzzles arising from being forbidden after a certain point from
  possessing certain objects or resources. E.g., you're not permitted
  cash, so you have to purchase things with bank accounts you've
  already set up.

- Puzzles about form id allocation into certain ranges

## Other thoughts

Requests-for-catalog are common, but tiered. There's probably a basic
form that you can address to most places that will get you basic
stuff, but even the same institution may offer more goods or services
if you send a higher "grade" of form, which may require a special
envelope, or to be typewritten, or to be accompanied with a photograph
or photocopy of some license card, or whatever.
